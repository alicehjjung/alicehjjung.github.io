Welcome to my website! 

About
======
Hi, I'm Alice.
I'm a master's student in Computer Science at UCLA. 

💡 My interest centers on **Artificial Intelligence**. I am also interested in applying AI to various fields. Therefore, I have experience from **Machine Learning** to **Natural Language Processing**. Having experienced different cultures throughout my life, I'm particularly drawn to developing and applying AI/LLMs for diverse people.

In my free time, I enjoy 🌐exploring new languages and 🎧listening to music. Currently, I on a 600+ days streak studying Mandarin and Japanese on Duolingo! My taste in music spans multiple genres, and I love discovering new good songs.
