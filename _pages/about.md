Welcome to my website! 

About
======
Hi, I'm Alice.
I am a fourth-year computer science and engineering student at Kyungpook National University. 

My research intersts center on Natural Language Processing. Especially, I am interested in Diversity in LLM, Multilingual LLM and Knowledge Base LLM. Having Experienced different cutlures throughout my life, I'm particularly drawn to developing LLMs that can adapt to and respect cultural diversity.


In my free time, I enjoy exploring new languages and listening to music. Currently, I on a 293-day streak studying Mandarin on Duolingo! My taste in music spans multiple genres, and I love discovering new good songs.
