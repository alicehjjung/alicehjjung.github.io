Welcome to my website! 

About
======
Hi, I'm Alice.
I'm a new master's student in Computer Science at UCLA. 

💡 My interest centers on **Artificial Intelligence**. I am also interested in applying AI to various fields. Therefore, I have experience from Machine Learning to **Natural Language Processing**. Additionally, I am interested in **Diversity in LLM**, **Multilingual LLM**, and **Knowledge Base LLM**. Having experienced different cultures throughout my life, I'm particularly drawn to developing AI/LLMs that can adapt to and respect cultural diversity.


In my free time, I enjoy 🌐exploring new languages and 🎧listening to music. Currently, I on a 590+ days streak studying Mandarin on Duolingo! My taste in music spans multiple genres, and I love discovering new good songs.
